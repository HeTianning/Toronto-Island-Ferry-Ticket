# Introduction

Ferries depart from Jack Layton Ferry Terminal to Toronto Island Park all year round. I want to count the number and status of Toronto Island Ferry tickets. Before downloading this data, I simulated what the data looked like and how it was distributed by understanding and analyzing the subject. After having a general idea of the data, I found some relevant data from Open Data Toronto, which provides near real-time information about ferry ticket sales and ticket redemption. The counts are updated every hour at 15-minute intervals. And downloaded this data. After downloading the data, I started to clean the data, cleaned and organized the data I needed to make the data simpler and clearer, and then tested the data. Finally, I used this data and R code to draw some images, and analyzed these images to get the number and status of Toronto Island Ferry tickets.

You can and should cross-reference sections and sub-sections. We use @citeR and @rohan.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. @sec-data....



# Data {#sec-data}
All the data comes from from @opendatatoronto.

Some of our data is of penguins (@fig-bills), from @opendatatoronto.

```{r}
#| label: fig-redemption
#| fig-cap: Redemption Count Over Time
#| echo: false

ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = Timestamp, y = `Redemption Count`)) +
  geom_line(color = 'pink') +
  labs( x = 'Timestamp', y = 'Redemption Count') 

#| label: fig-distribution1
#| fig-cap: Distribution of Redemption Counts
#| echo: false

ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = `Redemption Count`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = 'yellow') +
  labs( x = 'Redemption Count', y = 'Frequency')

#| label: fig-sales
#| fig-cap: Total Sales Count Over Time
#| echo: false

ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = Timestamp, y = `Sales Count`)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = 'skyblue') +
  labs( x = 'Hour of the Day', y = 'Total Sales Count') 

#| label: fig-distribution2
#| fig-cap: Distribution of Sales Counts
#| echo: false

ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = `Sales Count`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = 'orange') +
  labs( x = 'Sales Count', y = 'Frequency')

Talk more about it.

And also planes (@fig-planes). (You can change the height and width, but don't worry about doing that until you have finished every other aspect of the paper - Quarto will try to make it look nice and the defaults usually work well once you have enough text.)

```{r}
#| label: fig-planes
#| fig-cap: Relationship between wing length and width
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false


```

Talk way more about it.
