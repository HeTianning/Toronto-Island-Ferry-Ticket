# Repository for Toronto Ferry Tickets Counts Analysis

## Overview

Ferries depart from Jack Layton Ferry Terminal to Toronto Island Park throughout the year. I found some relevant data from Open Data Toronto to count the number and status of Toronto Island ferry tickets. This dataset provides near real-time information about ferry ticket sales and ticket redemption. Counts are provided in 15-minute intervals and updated every hour.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from Open data Toronto.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `data/simulated_data` contains the simulated data
-   `other` sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage
